## Overview

This project analyzes the Pokemon TCG market and aims to provide recommendations for the upcoming collectors. The analysis of card market datasets from the PokemonTCG group and CardMarket displays that older cards have higher value, modern rarities still have significant value, and basic cards without any special tags have high value. New collectors can use this analysis to choose the Pokemon cards with the valuable "details and invest early on the new card sets

## Business Problem

As a child, I have always been interested in Pokemon. I bought Pokemon cards growing up until my teens. There has been a resurgence in popularity in collecting the cards again recent years, as large media stars got into the hobby. I would like to analyze the current Pokemon TCG markte to predict the best new card investments in upcoming sets for myself and new collectors.


## Data

The data was gathered from the following:

* [PokemonTCG](https://pokemontcg.io/)
* [cardmarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/en)
